        <li>BlueChip Stocks</li>
        <p>A bluechip company is a reliable company in relevance to other companies. Most blue-chip companies involve technology as this service makes information accessible everywhere (as well as company products). However, lots of these companies also involve manufacturing. Companies like Coca-Cola and Fritos are also blue chip companies (as well as large wholesale store chains such as Costco, which has a relatively reliable and safe stock). However, some blue chip companies also involve banking, loans, and holdings, an example being Berkshire Hathaway (which is owned by one of the richest people on our planet). In addition to that, companies like Nike are also bluechip as they have a relatively stable income (as so many people regularly buy shoes from Nike).</p>
        <li>Index Funds</li>
        <p>Index funds are funds managed by experts from investment companies (such as Fidelity and Charles Schwab). These experts collect a set number of stocks and diversify money to have relatively positive net growth. They also read a ton of information about various companies to predict changes in stock prices (and determine bullish and bearish markets, which are essentially positive and negative markets). There is a small chance that every single stock will decline in price, which would be the only scenario where no one would use that index fund anymore.</p>
        <li>ETFs</li>
        <p>ETFs are Exchange-traded funds. They essentially work like a collection of assets, including stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies. These assets are designed to mimic the performance of a certain sector or stock.</p>
